# Kattis Problem Classifier

Project presentation video: [YouTube Video Link](https://youtu.be/D6WK1fjt-XE)

This project aims to make competitive programming studies on Kattis more focused and efficient by categorizing problems based on solution types. Using web scraping and OpenAIâ€™s API, this tool collects problem data, sends descriptions to ChatGPT for classification, and provides a consolidated Excel file that suggests a suitable algorithm type for each problem. This approach benefits anyone looking to streamline their practice in specific problem categories.

## Download the Results

For those interested in the problem classification results without diving into the code, the final Excel file with categorized Kattis problems is available **[here](https://github.com/jmfeck/kattis-problem-classifier/blob/main/data_outgoing/kattis_problems_combined.xlsx).**

This file includes an `Algorithm Type` column that reflects the classification provided by ChatGPT, indicating the type of solution approach recommended for each problem.

## Project Overview

The Kattis Problem Classifier project consists of several scripts designed to collect, process, and classify Kattis problems. Below is a breakdown of each script and its role in the pipeline:

### Script Workflow

1. **`kattis_problem_scraper.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Scrapes Kattis to gather basic problem data, including titles, difficulty levels, and other metadata, for all available problems.
   - **Output**: Generates an initial Excel file containing the problem data.

2. **`kattis_problem_description_collector.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Collects detailed descriptions for each problem by navigating to individual problem pages. This script runs in parallel to speed up the process.
   - **Output**: Adds a description column to the previously generated Excel, creating a new file.

3. **`kattis_problem_classifier.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Uses OpenAI's API to classify each problem description by solution type, like dynamic programming or graph traversal. Processes are managed in 250-problem partitions to ensure efficient handling and recovery if needed.
   - **Output**: Generates multiple Excel files (one per partition) with an `algorithm_type` column reflecting the classification by ChatGPT.

4. **`kattis_problem_classifier_consolidation.py`**  
   - **Purpose**: Consolidates the multiple partitioned Excel files into a single, final Excel file.
   - **Output**: Creates `kattis_problems_combined.xlsx` in the `data_outgoing` folder, containing all Kattis problems with algorithm classifications.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmfeck/kattis-problem-classifier.git
   cd kattis-problem-classifier
   ```

2. **Set up the environment** (with Conda):
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate kattis-problems-classifier
   ```

3. **Configure OpenAI API**:
   Set your OpenAI API key in the appropriate script or environment variable:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```

## Running the Pipeline

Follow this order to execute the scripts and obtain a final classification file:

1. **Scrape Kattis Problems**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/kattis_problem_scraper.py
   ```

2. **Collect Problem Descriptions**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/kattis_problem_description_collector.py
   ```

3. **Classify Problems by Solution Type**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/kattis_problem_classifier.py
   ```
   - Note: This script runs classifications in partitions of 250 problems each, resulting in multiple output files.

4. **Consolidate Results**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/kattis_problem_classifier_consolidation.py
   ```
   - Final consolidated file: `data_outgoing/kattis_problems_combined.xlsx`

## Additional Information

This project serves two main audiences:
- **Students and Developers**: Those who want to study Kattis problems by solution type can directly use the `kattis_problems_combined.xlsx` file as a reference.
- **Developers and Researchers**: Those interested in the methodology can examine the scripts to see how web scraping, parallel processing, and OpenAI API calls can be used to classify problems.
